“It’s amazing!” people on the internet said; your coworker kept talking about it; youtube kept on recommending videos about it to you.

Yep, tailwindcss.

You tried it... and you feel it’s not time to jump ship yet. You go back to your Sass based project. But something feels missing. There’s an itch, at the back of your mind, to use `gray-200` or `purple-900` or `red-50`. It’s just too convenient.

This is who coloree is for—now you can use tailwindcss’ color classes as Sass variables.

## How to install
### Using `wget`
1. In your terminal, `cd` to your the directory where your sass files live.
2. Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinliao/coloree/master/_coloree.scss`
3. Import `_coloree.scss` in your sass file.
4. Start using those sweet, sweet tailwindcss colors as Sass variables

### Todo
Perhaps there’s other more convenient method.
